Our lab has a new member. For next year's Masters projects, we are partnering
with a local tech consultancy to develop a robotic project. We'll be using the
[CrustCrawler AX-18A Smart Robotic
Arm](http://crustcrawler.com/products/AX-18F%20Smart%20Robotic%20Arm/) in the
project. Ultimately we're going to have four: one per student. Before that,
though, we need to make sure that we know what bits to get. She took quite a
while to put together but now Emma lives!

In case you're wondering, one possible project aim is to peel a banana with a
scalpel. The arm is, somewhat playfully, named after [Mrs Emma
Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Peel) from *[The
Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series))*.
