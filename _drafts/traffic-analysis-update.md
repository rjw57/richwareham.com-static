In September 2014, we presented a poster on some of the ancillary research I am
doing as part of my latest project supported by the [Centre for Sustainable
Road Freight](http://sustainableroadfreight.org). A [PDF of the
poster](downloads/srf-meeting-poster-sep-2014.pdf) is available to download for
those that are interested. The [source for the
poster](https://git.csx.cam.ac.uk/x/eng-sigproc/u/rjw57/srf/docs/poster-sep-2014.git)
is hosted on the University git service.

# Overview

The poster focusses on a single part of our wider research project on gathering
traffic flow data. Part A of the project aims to infer traffic flow directly
from video streams but knowing the current state of the world is only one part
of the problem; we are also investigating what techniques can be used to
predict the near future.
