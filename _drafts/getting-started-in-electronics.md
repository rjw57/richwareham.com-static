# The essentials

Unlike software, electronics is fundamentally concerned with individual
*things*. And the thing about *things* is that the incremental cost of making
and delivering an individual *thing* is far greater than software. (Making a
copy of a piece of software is very nearly free.) Hence you'll need to spend
some money. I spent quite a bit of money but if I were to bootstrap again, this
is what I'd buy:

* £5.48 - [Arduino UNO-alike](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UNO-R3-ATmega328P-CH340T-USB-Arduino-Compatible-Microcontroller-Board-UK-STOCK-/181678624617).
* £3.73 - [Solderless breadboard, wires and power supply](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MB-102-830-Point-Solderless-PCB-Breadboard-Jump-Cable-Wires-65pcs-Power-Supply-/360736049270).
* £16.74 - [Electronics component starter kit](http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=272_276&products_id=2009).

Prices inclusive of postage and correct at time of writing. Total cost: £25.95
or, again as of writing, around \$45 (US). Note that I'm not endorsing these
individual eBay sellers; YMMV when ordering from China.  I was also lucky in
that my Dad, on hearing of my new hobby, found a large box of chips, resistors,
capacitors, etc. in the garage. Most of my projects have now been driven more
by what I have for free in those boxes rather than what I've bought.

You can never have enough solderless breadboards. I bought a A4-sized
whiteboard from Poundland and stuck breadboards to it. This is a lot cheaper
than buying one of the metal-backed "advanced" breadboard modules. You can see
it in action in the videos above and, in an earlier state, below:

*(The video itself is the first test of using a
[MAX7219](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf) chip
to drive a set of seven segment displays from the Big Box. This ended up
forming the core of the debug board for my homebrew 6502 computer.)*

## Less essential essentials

Aside from discrete components like resistors, capacitors and LEDs, if you want
to play with digital electronics like I did you'll need some
[7400 series logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits).
I inherited a lot from my Dad in
the Big Box O' Joy. That being said, the chips you'll definitely want a handful
of are:

* 74HC00 - NAND gates.
* 74HC02 - NOR gates.
* 74HC04 - NOT gates.
* 74HC74 - D-type flip-flops.
* 74HC165 - 8-bit "output" shift register.
* 74HC595 - 8-bit "input" shift register.

The latter two chips are useful if you're using an Arduino to drive lots of
outputs or getting lots of inputs. You'll be surprised at how small "lots" can be.

There's a good
[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) video
on the use of flip-flops in computer memory if you don't know your "D-type"s
from your "JK-type"s.

## Knowledge

I started with a little basic electronics knowledge from school and a couple of
courses at University.  I was rather dismissive of electronics ad University
viewing it as a subject deeply steeped in "magic". As I've gotten older, I've
realised that electronics people viewed software as similarly being the domain
of wizards and sorcery. Such is any skill when viewed from outside.

That being said I was aware, perhaps distantly, of the following:

*   Voltage and current are different like "pressure" and "flow" are different.
    Current is the flow of electrons and voltage is how much those electrons
    want to flow.
*   Capacitors let *alternating current* pass but block *direct current*.
*   Diodes let current flow in one direction only.
*   Transistors act like an electrically controlled switch although I was more
    than a little fuzzy on the difference between NPN, PNP, bipolar junction,
    MOSFET, etc, etc.
*   Resistors obey [Ohm's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law).
    (Otherwise known as the **V**ery **I**mportant **R**ule.)
*   [Kirchhoff's circuit
    laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws). (Otherwise
    known as "current and voltage don't appear or disappear by magic".)

Of these, the first is the most important. If you're not sure of the difference
between voltage and current you're going to have a bad time and you should
watch some YouTube videos to get a good handle on the difference.

*Aside: more correctly, I was aware that current is the flow of the places
where electrons want to be. [Conventional
positive-to-negative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current#Current)
current flow predates the discovery that electrons are negatively charged!*
