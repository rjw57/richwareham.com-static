Hello Recruiter,

I hope you are well.

I've sent you this link because you have sent me a recruitment email. While I
appreciate that you're doing your job, I suspect that you've not looked terribly
hard at whether I *want* to hear from you.

I do not.

On the [contact](/contact) page on this site, which is intended to be in the top
few results when searching for my name, I say "I do not wish to receive offers
from recruitment consultants no matter how exciting the opportunity." Similarly,
my publicly listed GitHub email address starts
<tt>rich.no-recruitment-spam-please@&hellip;</tt>.

I'm fortunate enough to have a very specific set of skills: skills which make me
very useful for people like you. While I am most grateful for this and do not
wish to be seen as arrogant, I hope you can understand how galling it is for
those who often get trawled up when people Google "$BUZZWORD $LOCATION" to
repeatedly get almost identical recruitment emails. Should I be in the position
to switch jobs, I shall start by researching opportunities available then and
there. To paraphrase the oft-used sentence: don't email me, I'll email you.

Hence, I'm asking you to take the rejection implicit in this reply with good
grace and I look forward to you not contacting me again.

Thanks,

Rich
