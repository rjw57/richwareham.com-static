Hello Recruiter,

I've sent you this link because you have sent me a recruitment email. While I
appreciate that you're doing your job, I suspect that you've not looked terribly
hard at whether I want to hear from you. On the [contact](/contact) page on this
site I say "I do not wish to receive offers from recruitment consultants no
matter how exciting the opportunity." Similarly, my publicly listed GitHub email
address starts <tt>rich.no-recruitment-spam-please@&hellip;</tt>.

I'm fortunate enough to have a very specific set of skills: skills which make me
very useful for people like you. While I am most grateful for this, I hope you
can understand how galling it is for people who often get trawled up when people
Google "$BUZZWORD $LOCATION" to repeatedly get almost identical recruitment
emails. Should I be in the position to switch jobs, I shall start by researching
opportunities available then and there. To paraphrase the oft-used sentence:
don't email me, I'll email you.

Thus, I'm asking you nicely to take the rejection implicit in this message with
the same degree of inspecificity as you showed me.

Thanks,

Rich
