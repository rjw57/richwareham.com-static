Hello Recruiter,

I've sent you this link because you have sent me a recruitment email. While I
appreciate that you're doing your job, I suspect that you've not looked terribly
hard at me. On the [contact](/contact) page on this site I say "I do not wish to
receive offers from recruitment consultants no matter how exciting the
opportunity." Similarly, my publicly listed GitHub email address starts
<tt>rich.no-recruitment-spam-please@&hellip;</tt>.

I'm fortunate enough to have a very specific set of skills: skills which make me
very useful for people like you. While I am most grateful for this, I hope you
can understand how galling it is for people who often get trawled up when people
lazily Google "$BUZZWORD $LOCATION" to repeatedly get almost identical
recruitment emails. Should I be in the position to switch jobs, I shall start by
researching opportunities available then and there. To paraphrase the oft-used
maxim: don't email me, I'll email you.

Thus, I'm asking you nicely to take the rejection implicit in this message with
the same degree of inspecificity as that indicated by your initial missive.

Thanks,

Rich
