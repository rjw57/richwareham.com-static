# Electronic

The best way to contact me is via email.

<call-out center>
  Use
  <a href="mailto:rich@richwareham.com">rich@richwareham.com</a>
  for personal correspondence or
  <a href="mailto:rjw57@cam.ac.uk">rjw57@cam.ac.uk</a>
  for professional.
</call-out>

You may attempt to use any of the social media links on [my homepage](/) but I
rarely look at communication from people I do not personally know. If you must
use social media, [my Google+ profile](https://google.com/+RichWareham) is the
most useful place to interact with me.

I do not wish to receive offers from recruitment consultants no matter how
exciting the opportunity.
